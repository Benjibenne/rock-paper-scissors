- In all the pages of first page and game page we have our footer which include the rules of the game and how and why the player or the computer gains points. And if there anything confusing the user can always scroll down or look at the bottom of the screen to see the reason by the rules if the javascript alerts of result wasnt enough explaination for the result.

### Features Left to Implement 
- Features I want to implement in the future are some different font colors to the game possible beige or other types.
- maybe another image in front page so it got more flavour for users introduction to the battlefield game.
- As well changing the title name as time is short will change it later and fix the responsiveness to the title as this is an last second thought, it was best to push this forward when changes or improvement is warranted.
- And would maybe change the color of the play button and return to homepage button, as they dont stick out to the rest of the footer and header color as they share same color.

## Testing:

### Bugs 
- There where bugs in string errors that made the images not load the right url, which where solved by finding the right strings and changing the images name files.
- There where bugs in changing images in docs when fixing readme as I made extra changes to html pages. So had take new snipe pictures of the footer and the header which later caused more branch issues, which where solved by creating new gitpod by clicking the green button in github.
